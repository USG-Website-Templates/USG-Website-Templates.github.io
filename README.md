===============================

Instructions for creating a new microsite: 

1. Pick [which template](http://usg-website-templates.github.io/) you want to use.  
2. Click on the `code` link below whichever template you want to use.  
3. Click on the `fork` link* in the top right corner of the project homepage.  
4. Choose which organization you want to maintain your new microsite in (e.g. GSA).  
5. The project will fork, creating a duplicate for your use in the new organization.  Note: if you have already forked a project into an organization before, you may need to `clone` the project instead.  This can be done via [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/), [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/), the command line, or by using [this tool](https://copy-to.herokuapp.com/).  
6. Once you've created a new copy of the template, you can begin customizing it to fit your needs.   
7. The new site may take 5-10 minutes to generate and will be live at `https://[name-of-github-org].github.io/[name-of-project-repository]`.
